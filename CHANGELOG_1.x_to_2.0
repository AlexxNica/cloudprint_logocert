-  Power on's are polling waits - the script polls for privet advertisement from the printer

-  Passwords are no longer stored in plaintext, you will have to enter the password the first time you log into
   the USER account. You also have to manually accept the user data authorization prompt right after authentication.
   This process should happen only once per testing session as the Google account should remain logged in and
   OAUTH access and refresh tokens are stored on disk

-  Console output is now colorized and clearer to read

-  Google sheet output now separates testsuites with an extra row for clarity, and provides a single testcase
   re-run command when a testcase fails so you can focus on passing that test and ignore the rest
