Google Cloud Print Logo Certification Tool

Here are the major changes that occurred between version 1.X to 2.0
Please also see the README

-  No more WebDriver usage, all interactions are done via Privet or GCP interfaces now

-  Privet is used instead of the Chrome Browser for local printing now

-  _config.py has been overhauled, please see their comments in the file
        - New fields:
            - Under CAPS: MARGIN and GOODBYE_PACKET
            - SLEEP dict
            - Under IMAGES: PWG1, PWG2, and PWG3
            - Under TEST: RUN array
        - Removed fields:
            - GOOGLE_DOCS dict
            - Under TESTENV: CHROME and CHROMEDRIVER
            - Under UESR and USER2: PW

-  Power on's are now polling waits the script polls for privet advertisement from the printer

-  Power off's are now polling waits if your printer sends Goodbye packets when powered off; otherwise, it
   still needs the user to press Enter once the printer is off

-  Passwords are no longer stored in plaintext, you will have to enter the password the first time you log into
   the USER account. You also have to manually accept the user data authorization prompt right after authentication.
   This process should happen only once per testing session as the Google account should remain logged in and
   OAUTH access and refresh tokens are stored on disk

-  Console output is now colorized and clearer to read

-  Google sheet output now separates testsuites with an extra row for clarity, and provides a single testcase
   re-run command when a testcase fails so you can focus on passing that test and ignore the rest
